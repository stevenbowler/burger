Restaurant Order App

### Overview
This is a restaurant order-tracking app that enables the customer to `create` their own order, in this case a burger; `read` the status of the order; `update` the contents and/or status of the order; and finally, `delete` the order - in other words, all of the CRUD operations are represented.   This program was developed by Steven Bowler for the purpose of gaining experience developing a full-stack app employing best-practices for executing the [Model-View-Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC) software development pattern.  Additionally, the project provides this programmer the opportunity develop skills in creating and deploying a functional full-stack app on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), integrating [Express-Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars), [ExpressJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), and [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql). `Enjoy`.
